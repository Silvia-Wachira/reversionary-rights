<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>5.1.1 The appeal is directed against the judgment of the court in para. 3.9 that the termination of the agreements on 28 August 2011, with immediate effect, had legal effect. The complaints on appeal seek relief against the judgments of the court that the agreements, in view of the strong relationship they show with permanent contracts for an indefinite period, can in principle be terminated prematurely (section I.II and II), that such termination, in view of the requirements of reasonableness and fairness, implies that Nanada cs are obliged to transfer the music publishing rights back to [defendants] (part I.I) and that in this case there are insufficient grounds to judge that termination of the agreements is only possible where sufficient grounds for cancellation exist (section III).

5.1.2
In assessing the substance, the starting point is the Copyright Contract Act, which came into force on 1 July 2015 (Law of 30 June 2015 amending the Copyright Act and the Neighboring Rights Act in connection with the strengthening of the position of the author and the performing artist had not yet reached agreement with regard to agreements concerning copyright and neighboring law, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2015, 257) at the time of the Court's judgment.

(...)

5.4
Insofar as section I.I is based on the same principles as the complaints rejected in 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 above, it fails on the grounds stated therein. The complaint that, without further explanation, it is not possible to see why termination of the agreements entails that Nanada et al. is obliged to transfer the music publishing rights back and that a single reference to reasonableness and fairness is not sufficient, is unfounded. In the judgment of the court it was decided that the transfer of the music publishing rights was ancillary and inextricably linked to the obligation of Nanada et al. to promote and exploit the works. Based on this assumption and taking into account that the agreements themselves do not contain any arrangement for the consequences that a cancellation has for the publishing rights, in view of the provisions in art. 6: 248 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code - the judgment of the court that follows from the requirements of reasonableness and fairness that Nanada et al. must transfer these rights again to [defendants], does not show an error of law and is understandable without further explanation.

5.5.1
Part III complains, among other things, that in the light of the theses of Nanada et al. It is incomprehensible that the Court of Appeal finds that there are insufficient grounds for holding that denunciation of the agreements is only possible if there is sufficient compelling ground for the termination. Among other things, the section relies on statements about the nature and scope of the agreements and the fact that these constitute an important source of income for Nanada et al., from which investments in music authors and artists are recouped.

5.5.2
According to settled case law, the requirements of reasonableness and fairness in relation to the nature and content of the agreement and the circumstances of the case may lead to cancellation only being possible if there is sufficient compelling reason for this (see, for example, HR October 28, 2011, ECLI: NL: HR: 2011: BQ9854, NJ 2012/685).

5.5.3
In the context of the creation of the Copyright Contracts Act (see 5.1.2), attention was paid to the possibility of terminating an exploitation contract. In the preliminary draft that had been submitted for consultation, non-transferability of copyright during the creator's life was foreseen. This was linked to the periodic termination of exclusive licenses. As a result of objections, this regulation has been waived and a system has been chosen whereby the creator can dissolve in whole or in part the agreement in which he has transferred or licensed his copyrights for exploitation if his counterparty does the work within a reasonable period after the closing of the contract, the contract or after the last exploitation of the work is not or is no longer sufficiently operated. The power to dissolve arises after the maker has granted the party to whom the rights have been granted a reasonable period of time within which to exploit the work to a sufficient extent and that this exploitation does not take place within this period. (See article 25e Aw). The following is stated in the explanatory memorandum (Kamerstukken II 2011-2012, 33 308, no. 3, pp. 6-7):

"It has been decided not to introduce a periodical termination right because it is feared that the uncertainty associated with a termination right will lead to operators wishing to take fewer risks and that the measure would therefore have a profound effect on the investment climate. (...) In conclusion, an alternative proposal has been made by the Copyright Commission which would also have the consequence of the termination right that makers can award the exploitation to another party if the exploitation is not or insufficiently taken up by the party that has the rights. With the Copyright Commission, the government is of the opinion that the proposed result can equally be achieved by further elaboration of the non-usus rule. The decisive factor here is that a non-usus regulation does not have the potentially far-reaching negative consequences for the exploitation of the copyright that many have provided in the consultation on the non-transferability of the copyright and the associated right to cancel the license. "

It can be inferred from this that it is not considered desirable that exploitation contracts such as the present are automatically terminable because, in view of the investments that an operator undertakes for a work, this would lead to too much legal uncertainty, willingness to invest and ultimately not benefit the creators.
Instead, a system was chosen whereby the possibility of dissolving an agreement in the event of insufficient exploitation (non usus) has been further elaborated (among other things by stipulating that the operator must be given a reasonable period of time in order to still perform and by making provisions for in case the operator is unwilling or unable to transfer the copyright to the creator).

5.5.4
Although, as previously considered, art. 25e Aw is not applicable to the present case, it must be accepted in the light of the societal views that emerge from the history of the emergence that, given the nature and purport of an exploitation agreement such as this, in principle sufficient serious grounds are required for terminating it.

However, the undesirability of an unlimited cancellation option loses weight, as an exploitation agreement has lasted longer and investments can be recovered. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the judge can therefore come to the conclusion that in a specific case no weighty ground was required for the termination.

5.5.5
In the light of the foregoing, the part succeeds. The Court of Appeal did not motivate its judgment that no ground was necessary for the termination. In view of the theses of Nanada et al. presented above in 5.5.1, however, it was required to do so.</p>
