Cynthia Khoo,Canada,Copyright Act 1985 (Section 60),"R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42, section 60(2)",,http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/page-27.html#h-74,,"s 60(2): If the author of the work assigned or granted copyright in that work before January 1, 1924, then on the original expiration date, that would have occurred were it not for the passing of the new Copyright Act, the substitute right that the current Act provides for reverts to the author of the work. 

However, the owner of the copyright immediately prior to the original expiration date may choose one of the following: either 
(a) give notice to assignment of the right or grant of similar interest for the remainder of the current term of the right; the notice must be given within 6 months to 1 year before the original expiration date, sent by registered post to the author or (if cannot find author with reasonable diligence) posted in the Canada Gazette; or 
(b) without assignment or grant, continue reproducing or performing the work as before and subject to same payment as before (e.g. royalties) if the author demands it within 3 years after the original termination date. If it concerns a collective work and the copyright owner is proprietor of that collective work, then without any payment."

1. The author may dissolve the contract wholly or in part if the other party to the contract does not sufficiently exploit the copyright to the work within a reasonable period after concluding the contract, or does not sufficiently exploit the copyright after having initially performed acts of exploitation. The preceding sentence does not apply if the failure to sufficiently exploit the copyright within this period is attributable to the author, or if the interest of the other party to the contract in maintaining the contract is so compelling that, according to the standards of reasonableness and fairness, it outweighs the author's interest in that regard.

7. If the other party to the contract or the third party does not assign the copyright back within a stipulated reasonable period, then a court may, on application by the author, determine an amount that is reasonable in the circumstances which the other party to the contract or the third party must pay the author, in addition to any compensation due to the author."

Copyright Act 1968
",Section 239(4),1969-05-01,https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00414,,"Reversionary Rights. Under Australian Copyright Law there is a limited reversionary right that applies to works created between 1 July 1912 and 1 May 1969 set out in section 239(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). Background The Copyright Act 1911 (UK) applied in Australia prior to the commencement of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). Under The Copyright Act 1911 (UK) section 5(2) contained a reversionary right for authors. The 1911 Act provided that the term of copyright be set at lifetime of the author plus 50 years. In addition, it cut off any assignment or licence that went further than lifetime of the author plus 25 years. There were no hoops for the author or their estate to leap through, the author’s heirs simply receive an automatic reversion of copyright. This reversionary right has been preserved in section 239(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth); and applies in limited circumstances. Text of Section 5(2) – Copyright Act 1911 (UK)"
